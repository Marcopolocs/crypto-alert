# Hey there!

I'm Mark, a relatively new frontend web-developer. This project - Crypto Alert - was created for two main purposes:

- One is to practice all the things I learned throughout my journey in development. I poured most of my knowledge into this project.
- Two is to include it in my portfolio

## **MUST READ!**

You have to keep a few things in mind when checking the code in this repository:

1. If you want to explore all the features of Crypto-Alert you must run the **Access-Control-Allow-Origin** extension in your browser as the API I used in the project requires it
2. **This project is not yet finished** so some of the features might not fully work (such as receiving alerts). I plan to work on it in the upcoming period as well.
3. There is a secure registration process but **feel free to use any finctional email and password. A valid email format and a 6-length password is needed though!**
4. **Alerts and comments you create are stored on Firebase.** You can also delete both new and old items as there are no restrictions in this regard (yet ;))
5. If you have any tips, ideas or suggestions about how I could improve this small application or you just want have some talk, don't hesitate to make pull requests or drop me a DM at marcopolocs@gmail.com.

#### The functions of this website:

1. You can check more than 10 cryptocurrencies' prices and other details. These are fresh data using the CoinMarketCap API
2. You can set alerts based on these cryptocurrencies
3. You can leave a comment in the Forum section

Enjoy exploring this small application.

This project was created in Angular using v14+.
